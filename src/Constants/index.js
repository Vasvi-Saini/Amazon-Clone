        "review_content": "ABOUT  AMAZONBASICS:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAmazon Basics was launched in 2009 & is Amazon‚Äôs own inhouse brand for fast moving small electronic consumer goods.Here amazon uses its massive collection of sales data to launch products that are in huge demand & already exist in the market- but at lower prices. Simply put up a similar replica for something successful but at much affordable prices.If something isn‚Äôt an immediate hit, Amazon pulls it and moves on.Amazon otherwise is like an online marketplace where it provides a portal for various sellers to sell their product BUT with amazonbasics - Amazon is selling its own product at its own marketplace .Here it derives the benefit of eliminating any intermediate distributors or retailers & hence amazonbasics branded products are available for a lower price attracting bulk customers online.As an additional benefit, Amazonbasics products are delivered free to prime members & are covered under amazon warranty for all and hence any claim or replacement procedures are highly streamlined & immediately taken care of.ABOUT OUR PRODUCT ( REQUIREMENT vs ACTUAL):xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI recently purchased a new Qualcomm 3 Qbix car charger & was looking for a cable with USB A to Micro B connector. I listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements:1.) DATA EXCHANGE:*****************************Since it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car, Data exchange capability was not much of my concern. Preference though would surely have been a USB 3 but it didn‚Äôt bother me if I could only get a USB 2.0 too.ACTUAL PRODUCT: I did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and I found it to be pretty well. I did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred. The more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed.2.) LENGTH OF THE CABLE :**************************************Again since I could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob, I preferred to keep it short & simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or below.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely 0.9 meters or approximately 3 feet long. The length was sufficient for me to plug-in any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passenger‚Äôs seat.3.) TANGLE FREE/ FLEXIBILITY/ STRENGTH STANDARDS:**************************************************************************I am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent. I wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunched.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility , reasonable thickness & a sturdy intermediate cable. The whole construction of the cable due it‚Äôs cable size & flexibility is almost tangle-free.The associated cable was not exactly thick but can‚Äôt be termed as thin or delicate too. It‚Äôs not the thickest I‚Äôve seen but then thickest doesn‚Äôt always means most durable. Given my application it‚Äôs more than just suitable.The overall built & quality of the cable & insulation looks promising enough to last few years. Even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last long.I had further shortlisted mansaa & an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement.4.) COMPACT MOULDED CONNECTORS:*********************************************************Had an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal PCBs.ACTUAL PRODUCT : There are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable. The connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open. The connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spaces.The connector ports are sturdy enough both at USB A & micro B ports. The micro B port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite good.No signs of loose construction.Being Gold-plated is more of a misleading & fancy term(in this case) as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance & nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways.5.) AVAILABILITY OF TIES/VELCRO STRAPS :***********************************************************As per my intended use in a car where compactness was of paramount importance, I expected an included cable tie or a Velcro strap would be a nice add-on to properly adjust & arrange the cable as per requirement.ACTUAL PRODUCT: This I miss the most in the provided actual cable, there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which I could adjust my required cable length easily.6.) DECENT CURRENT HANDLING CAPABILITY:******************************************************************On the newest QC 3.0 certified chargers the current transmission can go up to 3.4 amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have a decent current handling ability.ACTUAL PRODUCT : The actual cable has a nameplate rating of handling up to 2.1 amps against demands at new QC 3.0 chargers that could go up to 3.4 amps. Here, let me clear out that the latest QC chargers vary voltage to current ratios to achieve desired fast charging  & thus it is not like a continuous flow of 3.4 amps is there, it keeps on reducing hence cable ratings designed for a continuous current handling of anything above 2.0 amps would sufficiently work with QC 3.0 chargers.Have tried it safely multiple times charging my Samsung S7 from 10 % without the cable getting hot.7.) WARRANTY:************************Comes with a 1 year warranty as expected. Not the best in the industry but reasonable.OTHER OBSERVATIONS:*************************************Apart from the above listed features, the other details of the actual product received worth mentioning are:8.) The cable is manufactured in China & imported by amazon warehouse dealers under the brand name & philosophy of amazonbasics.9.) The cable has a manufacturing date of Oct 2017 & it was imported to India in Dec 2017.10.) The cable has a MRP tag of 495 bucks however I purchased it online for 269 bucks.being a prime member shipping was free.11.) A customer care toll free number & email is also printed over the label for registration of any consumer grievances.FINAL VERDICT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxIt has been few days since I have received & been using this product. So far everything from construction to performance seems to be convincing enough to recommend it and for a price of around 260 I suppose, its worth it.Will surely update if any malfunction is observed.,Worth for buy!,The quality that amazon basics at times give at cheap prices is beyond imagination. simply superb, goverment shouldnt hinder amazon products , amazon products rather gives competition to local qualityless products which consumers are forced to buy beacause they have no quality competition. Make in india is good, but if the make in india products are simple cheap copies of branded products without any investment in R and D, without R and D make in india would never be successfull and ousting companies like amazon will only lead to loss for consumers , govt should infact encourage such competition.,Amazon basics provides one of the best cables available for charging your phone or connecting devices.As an past customer of many cables from Amazon this cable doesn't also disappoint,Supports fast charging for all my Samsung phones.I use Samsung a9pro 2016, Samsung s8plus 2017, which this cable is compatible with .Very sturdy, thick and very long. 6 ftVery affordable pricing. Thanks AmazonI also use a USB c cable for my Samsung s20fe.,Super,Product charging is ok.. however it's mere 1 foot in length..  the vendor could have mentioned  correct product description.. there is no need to mislead.. too early to say performance as I have received it today.,Good,I have bought many cheap chinese micro usb cable in Rs 50 and Rs 100 of ubon and of many other chinese local companies,and none of them worked properly.Finall i decided to go for this.And it is charging as well transferring data, without any issue and i am very happy with my purchaseMy advice : Dont buy, cheap chinese local cables of.You will have to throw them in dustbean after some time.Better buy this one.",

Its all because this brand wins my trust by provinding great quality with reasonable price,na,tested with 2.4 amps charger and phone. gives full 2.4 amps power to phone.the cable LOOKS thick and it has nice texture. despite that, i am sure it is not very durable. the usb connectors are extremely sturdy and they dont bend or flex. the wire will break before the connector does!!warning: usb micro connector has a strong hook. be careful while plugging and unplugging, or you may damage your device.very cheap and usable cable for 120 rs,Super power,Nice product.,In this price this is the best one",

The screen is not full HD but still offers good brightness and color accuracy. Speaker also sounds good enough. Front camera is not for selfies only for video calls but back camera produces satisfactory clicks for entry level. Battery backup is one of the best features of this device. Samsung softwares are all well optimised and my only complaint in this department is the pre-installed bloatwares. UI feels smooth enough and the mediatek processor coupled with 4GB RAM is well suited for daily normal usage. Games are not recommended. Biggest disadvantage of this device is it's in box charger which is only 7.75 watts (5v, 1.55a) that takes about 3 hours for a decent charge.,üî• Heating issues during use with in 15 minutes uses.Touch screen üì± issues some times it's too great and some time u have to touch several times even on samsung key pad while typing.We all family are using samsung mobiles but this time I worried of issues if I have to face same issues i have to change mobile and transfer data it's very irritating work I wish to if any one of samsung is reading this review please reply me through Amazon.üî• 15 ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§®‡§ü ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§â‡§™‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó ‡§ï‡•á ‡§¶‡•å‡§∞‡§æ‡§® ‡§π‡•Ä‡§ü‡§ø‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡•§‡§ü‡§ö ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§® üì± ‡§ï‡§≠‡•Ä-‡§ï‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§ú‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à ‡§Ø‡§π ‡§¨‡§π‡•Å‡§§ ‡§¨‡§¢‡§º‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§≠‡•Ä-‡§ï‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§Ü‡§™‡§ï‡•ã ‡§ü‡§æ‡§á‡§™ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡•á ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§Ø ‡§∏‡•à‡§Æ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§ï‡•Å‡§Ç‡§ú‡•Ä ‡§™‡•à‡§° ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§à ‡§¨‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§∂ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡§æ ‡§™‡§°‡§º‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à‡•§‡§π‡§Æ ‡§∏‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§™‡§∞‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§∏‡•à‡§Æ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§Æ‡•ã‡§¨‡§æ‡§á‡§≤ ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§â‡§™‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§∞‡§π‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç ‡§≤‡•á‡§ï‡§ø‡§® ‡§á‡§∏ ‡§¨‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡•à‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§¶‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§∏‡•á ‡§ö‡§ø‡§Ç‡§§‡§ø‡§§ ‡§π‡•Ç‡§Ç ‡§Ö‡§ó‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ù‡•á ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§æ‡§® ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§¶‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§∏‡§æ‡§Æ‡§®‡§æ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡§æ ‡§™‡§°‡§º‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§§‡•ã ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ù‡•á ‡§Æ‡•ã‡§¨‡§æ‡§á‡§≤ ‡§¨‡§¶‡§≤‡§®‡§æ ‡§π‡•ã‡§ó‡§æ ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§°‡•á‡§ü‡§æ ‡§ü‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§Ç‡§∏‡§´‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡§æ ‡§π‡•ã‡§ó‡§æ ‡§Ø‡§π ‡§¨‡§π‡•Å‡§§ ‡§™‡§∞‡•á‡§∂‡§æ‡§® ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡•á ‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§Ö‡§ó‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•ã‡§à ‡§∏‡•à‡§Æ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§á‡§∏ ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•Ä‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§æ ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§™‡§¢‡§º ‡§∞‡§π‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§§‡•ã ‡§ï‡•É‡§™‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ù‡•á ‡§Ö‡§Æ‡•á‡§ú‡§º‡•Ö‡§® ‡§ï‡•á ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Æ ‡§∏‡•á ‡§â‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§∞ ‡§¶‡•á‡§Ç .,Bought for mom as she just want to use for calls.

It was a good fit for the said user.  Thank you Samsung and Amazon.,Normal phone with very average screen quality. Battery backup also not very good. But yes its worth it.

        "review_content": "Purchased this last month. It's good as working fine for me. Size is bit small but you can easily toast 2 normal breads at one go. Just make sure you fill same amount of stuff in both sandwich so that both gets heat properly from both side. Cord is bit small but it's good if you have plug near your kitchen. At first use it smells like wire is burning but after next usage that smell will not appear. Cleaning of the product is bit difficult as you can't wash directly under tap. You need to use clean cloth with wetted with water. You can use some liquid soap but make sure it gets cleaned with clean cloth. Apply some butter or ghee on both side of bread before making sandwiches else it will stick to your plates in grill.,Overall good.,It is Ok but does not look sturdy enough.The top and lower heaters are not parallel if the sandwich is a little thick.A little better design would have avoided this problem,Makes the breads go crunchy from soft. 10/10 would recommend.,Very nice easy to use except there is no temperature control knob . I like my sandwich more crisper,Quality is good and easy to use , received in 24 hours,Product is Good i post review after 4 months from purchaseSufficient for 3 to 4 family memberI suggest go it,easy to use and easy to clean.not bad at all.2 issues:1. the hook is on one side so if your sandwich is a bit bulky, then the upper half may be tilted and loose on one side.2. the hook is also flimsy so there is a risk of breaking.",

        "review_content": "Perfect for winter,MEETS ALL MY REQUIREMENT,Good but expensive product with working process,Since I have tried Bajaj 13 fins oil heater, this 11 fin heater is not worth it. The quality is good just for the looks however the fins are very thin and unable to produce the same heat with same power as Bajaj.Although I am comparing it with Bajaj 13 fins still the room size was 12x10ft and borosil heater really struggled to even put the room to a comfortable temperature. With Bajaj it was done within half hour however borosil took even 2 hrs and still we were feeling uncomfortable.The fan placement is low and it doesn't converts that much heat for faster heater even with max settings.Please check both physically if possible, Bajaj is on a heavier side and fins are of good quality.Though I received 2 defective Bajaj heater ( physical dent on body) from cloudtail , I have again ordered the same. Hope this time it turns out to be good.No company is providing the details of the oil quality used in their product. Good luck.,I have used bajaj oil filled heater before. This feels more sturdy. I think havells and borosil make the best quality oil filled heater in terms of sturdiness and finish. Although it‚Äôs a simple assembly but still I wanted to buy a good brand as it draws a lot of power and I was concerned about safety.It makes the room warm quickly. Based on the power mode you choose. It will make the room dry. I have seen people using  water vaporiser alongside but on low power I haven‚Äôt felt too try in 1-2 hours of use.Overall, since it was borosil, I expected an even more beautiful look but since it works well I am happy. Easily 1.5-2 k costlier than its peers.,Using 3rd Party off-brand blowers for years, I finally took the leap and bought the 13 fin Volcano from Borosil. It has transformed the way with its reliability and efficiency.Packaging:The item was secured and packed very well with amazon packaging along with the original Borosil Packaging.Assembly:Using the provided guidebook was easy to understand. The unit comes as assembled but you have to attach the castor wheels which was pretty easy. Then all was left was to plug it in.Usage:The heater warmed up the 20ftx20ft room with relative ease. It has 3 power levels for the fan attached and a temperature regulator. The heater takes 5-6 minutes to heat up and bring the room up to temperature.Looks:The product looks very well and the black fin structure helps meld well with any decor you have in your room.Additionally, the two-year warranty and the safety features make it a must-buy product for winters.9/10 would buy again,Did not give the expected result,Ordered this OFR a month ago and have had used it since then. It is a powerful product to warm up the room pretty quickly. Although the first few minutes are slow but then it picks up the pace and evenly heats up the entire room. It is quite and doesn't even vibrate. I already own an OTG and an egg boiler and now the OFR. Borosil has stood up to the mark providing good quality appliances at a decent price tag.",

        "review_title": "THE PERFECT PHONE ‚Äì FOR MY REQUIREMENTS,Galaxy M33 5G a mixed bag of Affordability",
        "review_content": "I would not consider buying an i-phone simply because my friend owns two of them ‚Äì or blindly go for a new Android model suggested by my son or nephew (both of whom are more tech savvy than me) because their recommendations are obviously based on their own needs and expectations, which may differ from mine. I am an old-fashioned mechanical engineer with a basic understanding of parameters like millimetres, megapixels and megabytes ‚Äì but I think of a cellphone as a utility item, not a status symbol. Applying a technocratic approach, I would not choose a costlier option unless I get additional features which suit my requirements.My foremost requirement ‚Äì which is entirely non-negotiable ‚Äì is that my handset must have provision for two SIM cards, since I do not want to carry two separate handsets for my CUG and personal numbers. My other requirements are not difficult to fulfil: a phonebook with at least 2000 contacts, basic net connectivity, a basic camera for photos and videos and scope for downloading a few apps such as the ubiquitous WhatsApp and my favourite word games (which do not need much memory or processing capacity). I would certainly appreciate practical features like high reliability, software and security updates and high battery capacity (sufficient for 24 hours or preferably 48 hours at my normal level of usage). Besides, I would like to use a new handset for at least two years.Apart from exigencies, I do not intend to use my cellphone for surfing the Internet, videoconferencing or sending e-mails as I prefer using a desktop or laptop for such activities.I am equally clear about what I do not need. I do not intend to use my cellphone for watching movies, reading books, listening to music or creating fancy social media posts. Nor do I want a device for taking high resolution photos during a vacation as I would prefer to use a camera. At the risk of sounding flippant, I would say that I do not want a device to unlock my car or count the strokes in a game of golf ‚Äì primarily because I do not own a car and I do not play golf!Having used smartphones of Samsung and Motorola makes over the past few years, I vastly prefer the former. My last phone, which gave me over 30 months of good service, was a Samsung M30. Since that model is obsolete now, I focused on its upgraded cousins: M32, M33 and M52. The last was immediately ruled out as it does not support two SIM cards along with an SD card. After studying the relative specifications of M32 and M33, I concluded that the latter offers better value for money. Generally, it is worth going for the higher memory and higher RAM versions as these parameters affect the performance and the difference in cost is relatively small. With these considerations, I narrowed down my choice to M33 with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage (Just twenty years ago, I was using a desktop with 2GB memory!)As a confirmation for my choice, I compared the phone I had selected with OnePlus Nord CE 2 (8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) which my son had recommended. The specification of the Samsung phone was found to be equivalent or superior for the major parameters, except that the display screen technology was TFT instead of AMOLED. I also watched some Youtube videos about these handsets for a better appreciation of their competing features. The clinching factor was that the Samsung phone was priced substantially lower than the OnePlus product.As for body colour, my first choice was Emerald Brown, but I settled for the Mystique Green since the former was not available in my selected configuration. I was thinking this would be irrelevant since I use a case which completely encloses the handset, but it turned out that the body colour can be glimpsed through the cutout for the cameras on the rear of the phone.Despite a strong family resemblance with my old one (M30), the new phone (M33) offers decidedly superior specifications and it meets my requirements perfectly. It is a few millimetres longer and a few grams heavier than my old phone, but these differences are acceptable to me. Thanks to the 50MP front camera and 8MP selfie camera, the quality of photos and videos is above my expectations (see sample pic taken at night at a distance of about 30 metres from the stage).  This phone offers two years of android updates and four years of security patch updates, which reduces the worries on these fronts. Youtube reviewers complain that the M33 has plain looks, it is heavy, its audio does not offer an ‚Äòimmersive listening experience‚Äô and its screen is plain old TFT instead of AMOLED. I am willing to live with these perceived shortcomings, so long as the M33 meets my requirements.I was glad to find that Samsung has taken an environmentally friendly step of offering many models of handsets without chargers ‚Äì because old chargers, like old handsets, add to e-waste. However, it needs to be kept in mind that new handsets require higher capacity chargers. The recommended charger for M33 is 25 watts, but the chargers I had at home are rated at 5 or 10 watts.To cut a long story short, I ordered a 25-watt charger along with the phone to avoid compromising with the charging time. After using the new handset for a couple of weeks, I find that my phone is at 60-70% charge at the end of the day, and it takes 30-40 minutes for complete charging (one of the useful features of M33 is that it shows the time remaining for complete charging as soon as it is plugged in for charging). It turns out that I could have managed with the old 10-watt charger, except that it would have taken 60-90 minutes for full charging.I conclude by emphasizing that Samsung Galaxy M33 5g is the perfect phone ‚Äì but for my requirements. A word of advice: if you are planning to buy a new phone, it would be helpful if you list out your requirements so that you do not end up paying for features that you do not intend to use.,With 5G connectivity, a 120Hz display and solid performance, the Galaxy M33 5G is Samsung‚Äôs best-value smartphone yet under 20K segmentPros¬†Almost half the price of Galaxy A53Exynos 1280 is a solid performerExcellent 120Hz display with smooth experience across the boardHuge performance uplift over M32One UI 4.1 based on android 12 has tons of good features to love, none of the flagship grade features are skipped here (apart from dex mode and spen features), Zero lag or stuttering in 120 hz mode with ease of use and seemless switching of apps without any crash or reloading¬† of apps, makes using one ui pleasure to surf acrossYou get features like a¬†screen recorder,¬†video call effects, Game Launcher,¬†Link to Windows,¬†Dual Messenger,¬†Quick Share,¬†Music Share, and Secure Folder, along with many others. Some of the fancy Android 12 features, like the ability to¬†change the color palette¬†of icons and menus based on the wallpaper and¬†dim the screen for easier reading in the dark, are also included.Voice focus for calls is excellent feature, phone call quality is really good even in nosiy and crowded areasI had no issues with GPS or connectivity while using Google maps to navigate,¬† signal stays strong even in rural areas, thats a positive point with good accuracy4g Volte with carrier aggregation works flawlesslyWifi connectivity on the Dual band 5ghz router is strong and performs¬† more than satisfactorily with low latency responseBluetooth 5.1 connectivity is strong and has good range¬† no worries of disconnection even as far as 15 metersAudio quality via 3.5 mm jack is excellent compared to Redmi note 10 pro, much more defined and well roundedFor media consumption widewine L1 support is present, Good AV experience on ott platforms, I have no serious complaints about color reproduction in videos considering TFT LCD this panel does a good enough job .Main Camera 50mp is on par and better than Redmi note 10 pro in almost all conditions, retains colors close to reality with good dynamic range and handling of exposure with HDR in photos as well as videos, it is able to handle extremely bright conditions wellEven in shadows during day time it was able to maintain good colorsGood Stable videos at 1080p4k video recording is available at 30 FPS is availableMany cool camera features , boasts AR fun mode, single Take, Object Eraser and Video TNR (Temporal Noise Reduction) which makes it fun to use cameraSelfie camera has good punchy colors, Samsung's way of boosted colour processing some may like it ,some may notExcellent battery life, got 9 hours of SOT despite the heavy usage. It takes around 1.5 hours to go from 0-100, and half an hour of charging can take the battery percentage to around 45% provided you have 25 watt Samsung‚Äôs chargerDespite summer time, phone has managed to stay relatively cool, 5nm architecture helping its cause here12 5G BandsDedicated SD card slot is a plus herePD 3.0 25 watt fast charging support reasonable for price segment but we have seen faster charging speeds with other OEMsPromised 2 major android OS updates and 4 years security updates is a huge plus above its competitors, making this device more value for money in long runCons¬†Ultrawide camera is on softer side , lacks details compared to its primary sensor but manages to frame good shots that one can post on social media, macro camera is good with colors and edge detection but lacks depth of field and details , Note 10 pro which is brilliant in this caseNight shots are above average mostly grainy and muddled but better than most smartphones in its segmentLacks some stability in Video recording at 4k¬†Amoled display could have made it unbeatableLacks stereo Speaker, but audio quality on single speaker is quite goodPre-installed bloatwares like Moj, dailyhunt, sharechat, byju's are mild and uninstallable but makes mature one UI experience looks immature out of the boxCurrently device is not tunned for high gaming performance as limited FPS in popular games like BGMI and COD deters it away from being a gamer friendly device, but we¬† can expect exynos 1280¬† to resolve over time and be more optimized for more games in future updatesSlightly cheap design , Chunky in size, carries some heft, Dated notch displayLack of charger in the box is a bummer, which adds up to the value cost proposition",

Used almost all renowned brands but this one is class apart. 3rd purchase in the family circle,Nice,It is unique machine it can do everything which we went from a. Juicer machine fine quality of mixing grinder in few seconds and use both domestic or shops and very easy to use and clean I choose it after many machine used it is best all of them.,If u want to take out the juice after several days gap then u can prefer it,bit on the regular basis it is not good because I had taken out mausambi juice from it but it's waste was not containing some juice in it which can give a loss to u.  Else it's good.,I have not used juicer thus, 4 stars. But mixer grinder is excellent. Even hard items like coconut ü•• pieces grind in just 3-4 turns. Very happy with the product . Easy to clean. Just waiting to use the juicer though.,Very good experience using this produc from year's.,Very nice products and most powerful motor,Nice Machine meets the purpose as I was looking for a strong performing juicer. its just that. manufacturing quality is also good and sturdy. though I feel the motor is loose fitted as one can feel it hitting both sides inside while cleaning or shifting",

It holds on sturdily, minor block on AC flow is not of much consequence.The phone clamp is spring loaded and accommodates all phone sizes.Most holders working on suction does not hold onto glass. They fall off while driving. Could lead to accidents.,Good product, but didn't work for me, as it was unable to hold my Moto G60 device's weight. The clamp mechanism was great. I loved it! But the back clip which goes inside the AC vent was loose and kept on moving. Also the lock which tightens the back clip was average.,Received today. The product is of good build quality. It gives a feel of premium product. Not used it so cant say about functinality.,Product is good but fitment in ac vent with mobile phone placed on the holder increases weight which is not desirable,Good quality in this price range. It will however block your AC vent. Easy to mount and unmount your phone. Quite sturdy although not perfect. Has been able to maintain its composure even on bad roads.

Since it was white, and therefore a very unappetising sight now, I needed a new one.Packaging: The design of packaging was perfect - stiff corrugated sandwich board box, foam profiled panels stuck on board for bottom and top, board wrapping around the glass kettle, the whole unit inside a thick ply cover. Frankly, this sort of packaging is more common in high end audio equipment. 5 * plus for the packaging design.Size: This is a small machine - and will make about 600 ml of coffee - sufficient for 2 mugs in one go. If you need a larger volume - look elsewhere.Body and finish: The plastic body is well made - the matte finish looks good. The bottom metal plate is seamless and black - will have to wait and see when spots appear. The kettle is good quality glass, and though no branding is present, feels thick enough to withstand minor washing bumps. The filter bucket and the holder with the flow control spring is OK - hopefully the spring and washer - which are fixed - will last. The lid moves smoothly and the hinges and the sprinkler also look sturdy. Switch is firm.Function: It worked very well on the first use. I had used an extra coffee filter paper on top of the nylon filter bucket. The flow was smooth. Coffee liquor starts weak, and then picks up strength. The drip stops well with the removal of the kettle - and though the manual cautiously states a 10 sec gap for drip stop, I did not find any leakage on longer removal.Overall: Very satisfied with my new coffee maker. Recommend buying.,Product doesn‚Äôt work within a month,Easy to use, and it turned out better than I expected it to be for the price.,Just Magnificent. Saves lot of time.,The plastic quality for this product is poor. It feels like a toy. I had bought a Amazon basics air fryer it had great build quality comparing to this Amazon basics product,If you try to find a replacement part it costs twice its value,its cheap and breakable. And the coffee is very very light,waste of coffee and also not a good flavour.,Nice product and simple to use",

        "review_content": "ABOUT  AMAZONBASICS:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAmazon Basics was launched in 2009 & is Amazon‚Äôs own inhouse brand for fast moving small electronic consumer goods.Here amazon uses its massive collection of sales data to launch products that are in huge demand & already exist in the market- but at lower prices. Simply put up a similar replica for something successful but at much affordable prices.If something isn‚Äôt an immediate hit, Amazon pulls it and moves on.Amazon otherwise is like an online marketplace where it provides a portal for various sellers to sell their product BUT with amazonbasics - Amazon is selling its own product at its own marketplace .Here it derives the benefit of eliminating any intermediate distributors or retailers & hence amazonbasics branded products are available for a lower price attracting bulk customers online.As an additional benefit, Amazonbasics products are delivered free to prime members & are covered under amazon warranty for all and hence any claim or replacement procedures are highly streamlined & immediately taken care of.ABOUT OUR PRODUCT ( REQUIREMENT vs ACTUAL):xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI recently purchased a new Qualcomm 3 Qbix car charger & was looking for a cable with USB A to Micro B connector. I listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements:1.) DATA EXCHANGE:*****************************Since it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car, Data exchange capability was not much of my concern. Preference though would surely have been a USB 3 but it didn‚Äôt bother me if I could only get a USB 2.0 too.ACTUAL PRODUCT: I did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and I found it to be pretty well. I did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred. The more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed.2.) LENGTH OF THE CABLE :**************************************Again since I could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob, I preferred to keep it short & simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or below.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely 0.9 meters or approximately 3 feet long. The length was sufficient for me to plug-in any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passenger‚Äôs seat.3.) TANGLE FREE/ FLEXIBILITY/ STRENGTH STANDARDS:**************************************************************************I am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent. I wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunched.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility , reasonable thickness & a sturdy intermediate cable. The whole construction of the cable due it‚Äôs cable size & flexibility is almost tangle-free.The associated cable was not exactly thick but can‚Äôt be termed as thin or delicate too. It‚Äôs not the thickest I‚Äôve seen but then thickest doesn‚Äôt always means most durable. Given my application it‚Äôs more than just suitable.The overall built & quality of the cable & insulation looks promising enough to last few years. Even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last long.I had further shortlisted mansaa & an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement.4.) COMPACT MOULDED CONNECTORS:*********************************************************Had an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal PCBs.ACTUAL PRODUCT : There are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable. The connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open. The connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spaces.The connector ports are sturdy enough both at USB A & micro B ports. The micro B port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite good.No signs of loose construction.Being Gold-plated is more of a misleading & fancy term(in this case) as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance & nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways.5.) AVAILABILITY OF TIES/VELCRO STRAPS :***********************************************************As per my intended use in a car where compactness was of paramount importance, I expected an included cable tie or a Velcro strap would be a nice add-on to properly adjust & arrange the cable as per requirement.ACTUAL PRODUCT: This I miss the most in the provided actual cable, there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which I could adjust my required cable length easily.6.) DECENT CURRENT HANDLING CAPABILITY:******************************************************************On the newest QC 3.0 certified chargers the current transmission can go up to 3.4 amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have a decent current handling ability.ACTUAL PRODUCT : The actual cable has a nameplate rating of handling up to 2.1 amps against demands at new QC 3.0 chargers that could go up to 3.4 amps. Here, let me clear out that the latest QC chargers vary voltage to current ratios to achieve desired fast charging  & thus it is not like a continuous flow of 3.4 amps is there, it keeps on reducing hence cable ratings designed for a continuous current handling of anything above 2.0 amps would sufficiently work with QC 3.0 chargers.Have tried it safely multiple times charging my Samsung S7 from 10 % without the cable getting hot.7.) WARRANTY:************************Comes with a 1 year warranty as expected. Not the best in the industry but reasonable.OTHER OBSERVATIONS:*************************************Apart from the above listed features, the other details of the actual product received worth mentioning are:8.) The cable is manufactured in China & imported by amazon warehouse dealers under the brand name & philosophy of amazonbasics.9.) The cable has a manufacturing date of Oct 2017 & it was imported to India in Dec 2017.10.) The cable has a MRP tag of 495 bucks however I purchased it online for 269 bucks.being a prime member shipping was free.11.) A customer care toll free number & email is also printed over the label for registration of any consumer grievances.FINAL VERDICT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxIt has been few days since I have received & been using this product. So far everything from construction to performance seems to be convincing enough to recommend it and for a price of around 260 I suppose, its worth it.Will surely update if any malfunction is observed.,Worth for buy!,The quality that amazon basics at times give at cheap prices is beyond imagination. simply superb, goverment shouldnt hinder amazon products , amazon products rather gives competition to local qualityless products which consumers are forced to buy beacause they have no quality competition. Make in india is good, but if the make in india products are simple cheap copies of branded products without any investment in R and D, without R and D make in india would never be successfull and ousting companies like amazon will only lead to loss for consumers , govt should infact encourage such competition.,Amazon basics provides one of the best cables available for charging your phone or connecting devices.As an past customer of many cables from Amazon this cable doesn't also disappoint,Supports fast charging for all my Samsung phones.I use Samsung a9pro 2016, Samsung s8plus 2017, which this cable is compatible with .Very sturdy, thick and very long. 6 ftVery affordable pricing. Thanks AmazonI also use a USB c cable for my Samsung s20fe.,Super,Product charging is ok.. however it's mere 1 foot in length..  the vendor could have mentioned  correct product description.. there is no need to mislead.. too early to say performance as I have received it today.,Good,I have bought many cheap chinese micro usb cable in Rs 50 and Rs 100 of ubon and of many other chinese local companies,and none of them worked properly.Finall i decided to go for this.And it is charging as well transferring data, without any issue and i am very happy with my purchaseMy advice : Dont buy, cheap chinese local cables of.You will have to throw them in dustbean after some time.Better buy this one.",

        "review_content": "I bought \"Havells 3lts Instant Geyser 4.5KW White/Blue\" and I'm really happy I made this decision.Let me start with why I went for \"Instant Geyser\" instead of \"Storage Geyser\".-Storage geyser's have a tank to store water and heat it.-For example a 10litre storage geyser fills up the 10 litre tank and then heats the water.-As it has to heat high volume (10 lts) of water it takes time of about 5 to 10 minutes-Instant geyser's on the other hand heat water instantly within 1 to 3 minutes-However the catch is they dont have a huge capacity tank which means at a given instant it has only small volume(depending on tank capacity) of hot waterNow who should opt for \"Instant Geyser\" and who should opt for \"Storage Geyser\" is the question ?- If you like to have a \"Shower Bath\" for which you require more than 10 litres of hot water continously then you should go for \"Storage Geyser\" since storage geyser of capacity more than 10lts will store 10lts of hot water and provide it to you as soon as you turn on the shower without any pauses-Instead if we consider \"Instant Geyser\" of 3lts capacity for shower bath, it cant provide you 10lts of hot water continously because for every 3lts it takes time to heat water again-Hence for a shower bath better to go for \"Storage Geysers\"-If you like to have a \"Bathtub Bath\" then instant geyser's are good to go because-Consider using a bathtub, a bathtub generally is of capacity 350lts-If you even use a \"Storage Geyser\" of high capacity as much as 25lts, still you will have 14 pauses of 5 to 10minutes each-Because at one shot this storage geyser can provide you only 25lts of hot water continously and then you will have to wait for 5-10mins for the next 25lts to heat-So to fill the entire bath tub, you need to have 14 times 25lts of hot water = 350lts-So the total wait time would be 14 times 7mins (on an average) = 98mins-In this scenario of \"Bathtub bath\" its better to go for instant geysers since they provide hot water almost instantly and eventhough there will be pauses for every 3lts of hot water still the pauses being very small you'll have a bathtub full of water with enough amount of heat/hotnessThen you might ask what should we consider for \"Bucket Bath\" ?-Both \"Storage geysers of 15lts or above\" and \"Instant geysers of 3lts or above\" are good to go-Just choose based on:  Price,  Time taken to heat ( instant takes less time ),  Energy consumption ( instant comsumes less )Now coming to \"Havells 3lts Instan Geyser of 4.5KW\", why I bought this ?-Havells is a great brand-I wanted to have it for \"Bathtub Bath\"-4.5KW heats 3lts of water in just 30 to 50secondsWhat I liked about this product:-I have been testing it from a week and it is really ossum as it is heating 3lts of water in just 45seconds ( I have used a timer to note that )-The installation was totally free, however remember you will be charged if there is any \"Plumbing Work\" do be done.-No need to buy any extra accesories like pipes, everything is provided in the box, you just need to buy a 16amp plug which would be less than 100rs-As soon as the product was delivered by amazon, I got a message from havells saying they have registered my installation request and the very next day the instalaltion was done, thanks a lot Havells ( This might differ for you based on your location, I live in hyderabad)-I really like havells customer service-The geyser comes with 2 years of warrenty for the whole and 5yrs of warrenty on the tank-It has \"Auto Cutoff\" feature to stop further heating or wastage of electricity if you forgot to switch off ( however please switch it off once done because eventhough it has auto cutoff, still once the water in the tank cools down it will again start heating and the cycle repeats )-It shows color indication: \"Blue when its heating\" and \"Orange when it has done heating\" ( Have a look at the pictures I have attached)Note:-Go for the 4.5kw model if you want hot water instantly in 30 to 50seconds, the 3kw model might take 2 to 5mins to heat 3lts of water-Make sure it is 4.5kw model because I see reviews from other customers who say the \"Mustard\" colored geyser is not 4.5kw but 3kw ( better go for white and blue color to be sure ),Very nice product,Good product,4.5KW rated heater is able to heat water in minutes and maintain that temperature for continuous flow of hot water. Good product,Great product at great price.,Value for money and instantly warm water comes in just 2min,Havella water heater,Water heats up in 45-60 secs depending on the weather.This review is after using this water heater continuously for 10-12 days in December, in Kolkata, with one of the days being extremely windy and lowest temperature at 14-15 degree Celsius (during afternoon/ early evening hours). On the coldest day so far, it took around 1min &10-15seconds to heat up completely.If you don't have chronic pain, or arthritis, or this is not going to be used for very old people, whereby really hot water is required for bathing, I think it can work perfectly for winters with lowest temperatures upto 9-10 degrees, because I have chronic pain and use this to get really hot water and for a shower, not using a bucket, and it's manageable.Obviously can't be compared to steaming hot showers using a storage geyser, but this heats quite quickly, so can be used in the shower even with the low capacity.For that same reason, it can be used for multiple people, because by the time one person leaves the bathroom and the next enters, you'll have fully hot water, only of lesser quantity, so if you don't live someplace cold, or don't need very hot water but mildly hot water, this can be used for multiple people as well.Installation support was also good.No cons, only that if Havells introduces a 5l instant heater in the 4.5kW range, then that would be a game changer and might give storage geysers a run for their money because this is perfect for anyone who doesn't have their own home and might need to move around, because it's compact, and provides instant hot water.",

        "review_content": "Sturdy packing, good product!,Have used this brand cable for my iPhone and iPad before, so when my wife's Samsung charger cable gave up the ghost in less than 6  months, I ordered this. Braided, visibly high quality cable, unlike the flimsy and highly overpriced OEM cables from Apple and Samsung. I have been using my iPhone cable from Wayona for more than 1 1/2 years and still going strong.  Hope this C cable will give a similar performance,I like Wayona chords and especially the long ones. But I get a slight shock - like a static discharge - when I touch my phone while charging with these two cords. Other cords with same charger are okay.,Ok,Cable looks solid and length is also good.Little bit fast charging I observed for phones like Redmi.It also looks solid so I am expecting it to work for atleast 1 year,build quality and fast charging feature,Unbreakable, good quality,Cable a Nice Product",

        "review_content": "I have been using this for about six months now. It is quite handy and is able to make pretty good fruit shakes and smoothies. I add a couple of ice cubes and it manages to crush them, but needs more than one cycle. Battery life is acceptable, I charge after every 5-6 uses. The motor runs at full all the time, I thought that I would be able to tell when the battery gets low but no, it will simply stop at the last second with no way to tell if it is getting low. Initially I wondered if the exposed charging port would lead to any problems or not, but I have been careful with it and have had no issues.I find it to be a great and useful product for one person. Get a proper non-portable blender if you want to use it for blending hard, dry substances, or for multiple people.,Easy to use,Best Blender used so far,Great product. Very compact and easy to carry. Can‚Äôt blend hard items but works for soft fruit smoothies or milkshakes. We liked this product,Build is solid. And the motor is powerful enough for its purpose. It would have been perfect if the charging port was not exposed.,Good oneSatisfied,I am using this product since 2weeks.It is good upto now. I am using this for only milk shake with banana only.its blending is good,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yaKvhqNSL._SY88.jpg",

        "review_content": "I am using OnePlus 10R 8GB 128GB more than one month. It is my first ever OnePlus phone. My personal review about this phone is as under:Pros:1. Boxy design looks nice but feels not so premium but if you use its cover it feels nice. Cover quality is very nice.2. Screen is bright even in sunlight if you select auto brightness. Also screen color and touch response feels premium.3. Battery life is very impressive with 1.5 day backup with normal use.4. 80 watt charger is very fast which charge your phone within 30 to 35 minutes.5. I am not a heavy gamer but I tried asfalt 9 which runs very smooth.I think it'll play heavy games smoothly. So it perform well.6. I am new to use Oxygen OS. I feels OS premium and smooth without adds.7. Rear camera shots very good pictures but selfie camera need some improvement which I think can be done via software update.8. No heating issue.9. Lightweight.Cons:1. If you use without case, it doesn't feel like premium phone.2. I don't like the sound quality although is has dual speaker. You can feel vibration on its back pannel which feels very bad.3. Selfie camera needs improvement.4. Zoom is very bad on rear camera.5. No IP certification.6. No expendable storage.7. Paid theme store.8. Should have some dot notch animations like samsung.  At last I can say it is a nice phone with some cons, if you want OnePlus smartphone within Rs. 35000/- you can go for it.,Terrific purchase at the price of 33k. Body I feel light htough it is not as usual OnePlus body as I had been the user of one plus in past also. Metallic sides could be a better option. Sometimes I feel lag in touch though it is for microseconds but it is there. Camera quality is good not awesome. Battery life is good i used to charge once and a day can be completed by itm Obviously, i bought it as it is one of the affordable option in terms of brand. Love to see metallic frames in coming phones. Storage is tremendous and speed is also good m Overall a good purchase a phone can be rated 4 out of 5.,This smart phone is good enough for daily normal use. But battery life is not good enough though is says 5000 mAh. Camera quality is not good enough in this price segment. Although it's Oxygen os, it is not well optimised. From the starting there will be some lagging issue with some apps. Another bad thing about this smart phone is its form factor. The company taking around 39k but giving just a plastic body which will looks like below 20k. If someone wants to buy this i suggest to buy another model don't go for this model because of the brand. One good thing is oneplus promised three major android update and four years security update. Another bad thing its primary camera design. One of the three camera is so big that it's embracing to say its price is 39k.,I would like to get directly to the pros and consPros.1) BATTERY - The first and the best thing about this phone is the damn battery life and how fast it charges. It's just amazing and I have been kind of spoilt by it now, I wont be able to adjust with a lesser battery performance and charging anymore!2.  CAMERA- The camera is amazing and takes some really amazing pictures. No complains.3. LOOKS - The phone looks really beautiful. I got the forest green colour and it looks simply awesome and is eye catching and premium looking.CONS1) The overall working of the phone is not as seamless as it should be provided the hardware it boasts of. Having said that, the factor cannot be a purchase deterrent. It's otherwise quite smooth2) The absence of an alert slider was a disappointed. I was used to it on my 6T3)Volume - Not too happy with the phone speakers. They somehow are not up to the mark.To sum it up- Just go for it if you have a tight budget but want a premium looking, good performing phone. It packs too much for a 43k phone - good battery, fastest charging in the segment, premium looks, good performance.,Using the phone after two days I have noticed weird experience with UI, tapping on grey or black areas screen flickers to that portion and according to service centre it's common issue across all phones and getting fixed by Oxygen 13 update as there were no issue with 10pro.So we have to do nothing but to wait for releasing the new OS update on the 10R and other models as well.Overall device working good so far I experienced average camera results,superb charging but not so extended battery life, touch sensor and speakers are fine and performance is good in my day to day tasks, hopefully UI and OS updates will help to deliver best of this phone.,Over all camera üì∏ is just ammazing I am a youtuber purpuse behind choosing this device is it's processer dimencity 8100max it's a supersaft max performence not even capturing while gaming also it's runs very smoothly and it's my FIRST PREMIUM SMARTPHONE I'm the uploded photos20x zoom lg pic and I have uploded night and day liting pics to compareGood device from one plus,Its speaker is not really working well using it since 6months only plus it dosent comes with a warrenty plan it has to be brought separate camera quality is also okay not thattt good microphone is also been disturbing a lot while talking on the call other side person gets a lot of disturbance",

        "review_content": "I am posting this after a few weeks of using the product.Usage: Continuous, OTT only, no Cable/Dish operator.Average daily usage: 6-8 hours.The TV is a great value-for-money product.Installation: The installation was simple and Amazon assisted installation was smooth, timely and hassle-free.Picture: The picture quality is not great when compared with the smoothness of a Sony, LG and Samsung with these kind of specs. Movies and especially hi-res TV series experience was somewhat diluted as most of the times, the output, while in hi-res , wouldn't look like a movie quality which we are used to of watching in the likes of Sony, Samsung LG etc however, with time, you get used to it and only realize the difference when you see the same movie at someone else's better TV.Sound: Sound output is decent. You wouldn't need additional support to enhance the volume as such.Remote: Sleek, sensitive and user-friendly. It's exactly like Amazon's remote.OS: Same as any smart Android TV. Works smoothly without much lags or hiccups. Switching apps from one to another takes a a couple of seconds more than Sony but unless you have used to of those performances, it looks just fine.Standalone and as your first smart TV,  you wouldn't find any reasons to not like the quality and it would like hi-res from the beginning. It is a great value for money product without a doubt.However, if you are considering this as an alternative or second TV after owning the better ones in the past, you will have a hard time adjusting with it.,Picture quality is good for this price, didn‚Äôt faced any lag on UI and browsing other apps. Only negative will be audio, definitely need a sound bar if u are a frequent movie watcher. Overall worth for money u spend. But the installation process is just awful, Amazon claiming that a trained professional will visit for installation but neither they are trained nor professionals , just read the installation manuals and installed the wall mount which took 4hours for them to buy the wall mount after charging money. No demo given on Tv as they have no idea about the product, these things making to think twice or thrice to buy a tv through online.,Screen looks amazing but problem is with processor I believe. If 4k content is getting streamed on device then we can observe the green screen flickers(not so often but problem exists), even remote control is not good as it take at least 2 sec to react for the user action.Reason why I believe processor is bad because I do 4k gaming using PS5 and never encountered problem with the screen.,If you buy TV in a small town shop, it will be delivered and installed immediately within couple of hours. When you want to buy a TV from Amazon, you need to wait for it to be delivered for couple of days and it is understandable. The problem is with the installation, they take so much time to install that you end up regretting buying the product. It‚Äôs like you are hungry and food is in front of you but you can‚Äôt eat. So I ordered my TV on Monday, it got delivered on Friday and it will be installed on Monday because of weekend where as there is no concept of weekend in small towns. If we had the technician details, we could reach out  s get it installed but that also will be shared 4 hours before.Regarding product, it‚Äôs good quality and very good for a average user. Heavy duty like games and continuous usage on some store will be challenging, I guess.,This TV gives good results within the budget, should definitely buy if the budget is 30k but most important point like to mention is after sales service and also the installation part.1) The installation guy didn‚Äôt arrive at very first day that was scheduled, even after rescheduling he didn‚Äôt came for installation purpose. So strictly be aware of this point.2) The TV I got in offer with 3k discount on ICICI card but although the product came out defective, it had dead pixel on the display which is very bad after period of time.3) Even after the fault was from seller as it was defective piece I didn‚Äôt got the replacement for the product and it‚Äôs totally unfair deal by Amazon and the seller too.Final verdict is the TV quality and feature are good but the service from seller and Amazon that is got was very poor inspite I was prime member. The seller DAWNTECH ELECTRONICS PRIVATE LIMITED gives very poor service and feel bad that in such cases Amazon will not help you. Thankyou,Team,Also to be added TV installation services with product while delivering and unboxing. NO need to other sub-vendor to getting installation and demo. Also dependency on third-party involvement should be less.Bad experience with TV installation stuff.Pls look into this .,Picture quality good. Sound quality  not upto my 3xpectations. Not able to find the real Dolby stereo effect. Remote not upto the mark.4 ‚≠ê for picture quality, 3‚≠ê for both sound and remote quality,Good quality picture but it hangs on home screen",

        "review_content": "Pros:1) Looking at the picture, I thought it would just be the blender with some cap to cover the blade. Turns out the \"cap\" was actually a pretty nice container to blend small amounts of anything. The container itself seems of great quality, has measurements on the side, and also comes with a lid so that nothing splatters outside when you're using the blender.2) There is also a holder with some nails if you wanna mount the blender on a wall.3) The blender itself is amazing to hold, looks great, and is pretty easy to use.4) The blender can even stand on its own if you have to leave it and attend to something else. If you place it vertically, you can leave it as it is.Cons:1) After over 15 seconds of continuous blending (that is, if I'm not just pulsing it but continuously blending), there is this smell of some sort that starts to come from the blender. I'm not sure if that's a sign of overheating, or if it's normal.2) There's this groove right above the blade, and every time I'm done washing, there's always a little residue that was hiding in that groove which always comes out a few seconds after I'm done washing, and I always have to go back to clean that. So that's a small inconvenience.But it's overall great, and I'd highly recommend getting this product!,Good,Making the life easy.,Great durability and original products,Very nice product for small or moderate usage.,Good product,Very good,Very useful product in day to day work",

So there are chances that if a 100 watt charger is used, it may heat up a lot. Overall the cord is well make, very sturdy and the materials indicate that this cord will be very very durable. The price would could have been on the lower side due to heating otherwise its a good buy.,Good for buy,Like it,I got this for my samsung s10 lite and it is compatible with super fast charger and charged my phone in Super fast charge mode. Value for money. Could not post picture but product is good. Far better than original Samsung cable which cost almost same.,The cable is sterdy, the ends are premium. Charges my One Plus 7T rapidly. Great data transfers on my Macbook as well. I am happy with the purchase.,Good cable,Worth it. Quality of cable is very good. Supports fast charging in Samsung Galaxy devices,Ideal for charging but not for data transfer.(gives an average speed of 30 to 35mbps with my ssd capable of more than 100mbps transfer speed and actually gives with its provided cable)",

        "review_content": "I recvd product within 3 dys while owing to rural area other product tks 10 dys to deliver n product recvd at gd condition n works well, aftr use if smthng cms up will review again,It works good. Nice heating. But hard to clean as it has ridges and small gap between the hot plate and the controls and also below the plate edges.. Other than that, fine product,2500 se jyada price nahi hona chahiye tha. Use karne mein bahut achha hai,Over all I'm really disappointed by the product and especially cooking experience. I was used to normal gas and it was easy to regulate to propper temperature. This product has only like 8 temperature settings and it is either too hot or too cold and cannot be set in middle. For example when I set 160¬∞C then it is burning toasts and onions... When I set one step lower it is 130¬∞C and it is not enough for frying :(((.Also you need to buy more expensive induction friendly cookware. And even when I invest to expensive Tefal pan it heat mostly in the center and it is much colder on the edges... You can see on pictures that watter boiling only in middle, and toast being burnt in middle and raw outside :((( The pan is very good and has induction area over whole bottom so I'm sure the fault is in this philips stove... You can see the pan from bottom that induction area is almost over whole bottom... Also due to fact that only center is hot then frying onions is taking much longer than on normal gas stove where heat is better distributed :((( And even though you spent more time frying the onions the result is worse... Onion is little burned from outside and still not soft inside... I'm really disappointed by frying experience compared to gas stove...There is one positive side and that is that heating is quick. My pressure cooker star whistling quite quickly. Faster than on gas stove. Also you can set time for like 10 minut and leave it which is quite convenient...Controll is easy. But I hate details. First I love one detail. There is \"pause\" button which is very cool. If something heats too quickly or you just need to quickly do something else you press pause button and there is no new heat - It is much nicer compared to gas stove where you would need to turn off, light up again and then find right flame again... Here you just press pause again and cook as before... But that is only thing that I love. Otherwise I hate how it is designed.... First basiclly whole top row of buttons is useless. Those buttons are preset temperatures. But anyway those temperatures are wrong or just for items you do not cook... Like there is 'stirr fry' button and it set 180C. It totally burns onion... I set usually 180C for beginning and then soon change for 160C. But even 160C is too much burning... But lower setting is only 130C which is not frying at all. I would need like 150C I guess and it is impossible to set :((( ...Also I noticed another issue that stove is sometimes making automatic pauses. It heats and than probably when it thinks it is too hot then it stop completelly and in like 10 seconds starts again. So instead of consistentn temperatures it is doing on and off.But back to controll. Except from fact that preset temperatures are useless when you want to change temperature it won't let you or let you to do only one '-' but not 2 times '-'. Why??? I don't know probably ill will... You need to first press \"manual\" button which change temperature completely to 130C and only then you can freely press +/- and set your desired temperature. So basically I never use any preset mode and I always only press 'manual' and +/- to set my temperature...Another control is setting time. I must say satting time is useful feature and I love it, but how it is implemented I hate. When you press time button then by default it set 30 minutes... Ok but when you hold '-' button it jumps so quickly that in one second it counts to 0 and roll to 3 hours.... Holding increment/decrement is so quick that it is useless. It must have implement some idiot... Anyway you can always click one by one. So to set 10 minutes you must click 'time' button and then click 20 times 'minus' button to set 10 minutes... It is doable but pretty annoying. Or I long press '-' it usially jumps directly to 3 hours and then I press 11 times +...  Still anoying but I save like 8 clicks... What is super idiotic is that when I want to add 5 minutes I click time and it by default set 30 minutes again :(((( Arrrrggghhhhh.... So instead of just click time and 5 times '+' I need to click 25 times '-' :((((.... Really this must have done some idiot.... Another unpleasant thing is that if you need to change temperature you can not... Imagine something starts burning and you need to wait like 3 seconds and not pressing '-'/'+' and then after those 3 seconds time setting mode is automatically left and it will let you change temperatures again... When controlling  stupidity is burning my food it makes me angry :((((So over all I would buy anything else next time... Maybe it will be worse but I would at least try...Anyway to say something positive at the end I like that product looks quite durable and material quality looks good. Packaging was also well. But power cable is only like 1.2 meters.... That might be too short... But for me just enough... Also I like mechanic buttons, some stove has capacity buttons which is cool looking and totally flat but I like to feel the press and the click. Buttons are under foil so there is no risk of something leaking into them. Cleaning is very easy cos it is almost flat :) Cleaning experience is much better than cleaning gas stove...,Product is good but service center problem not available nearly.,No1,‡§§‡•á‡§≤ ‡§ó‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡•á ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§™‡§∞‡•á‡§∂‡§æ‡§®‡•Ä,Ordered 3 one was faulty",

        "review_content": "I am not big on camera usage, personally. I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging, but it was just a little and so I could have ignored it. But then it started heating up more and got me very concerned. I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don't perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you (or not) in terms of camera and heating. I had many questions about these aspects before buying. Perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy (or avoid). Cheers.,Display - BeautyCamera - decentPerformance - AmazingBattery - ok (in 5000mah u expect more tbh)Overall good phone...Also after 1day of use, i found some network connectivity issue in my jiosim, which I'm using right now in this phone, but I'll keep update this review after 1month of usage!,It's a decent mobile under this price but few things worried me , weight of the phone, too many procedure to change some settings, no screen casting. Apart from that it has good touch, a decent camera for day light , battery life is good.,I bought this smartphone for my mom. Samusung interface is very handful for easy use. Battery is superb, last whole day. Camera is mediocre but provide original colour pictures. All in all satisfied with this smartphone that i got in sale for 9499.,Unable to do video call within same service provider as in VOLTE within same service provider video call feature is available.,Product is fine.  Nothing Fancy but for the budget it is a good phone.,BATTERY : more than enough for normal use  Not sure in gamingCAMERA : good in this segment , can record  videos in FHD 30fpsDISPLAY : since it's a LCD display the quality is  a bit less , but goodV RAM : you can add upto 2gb of virtual ram  but have to sacrifice your storage  Space to use it  OVERALL A GOOD BUDGET PHONE,Finger print is working speedy battery backup is good camera quality is also good",

        "review_content": "My review of using new Vacuum Mop Pro 2 for 3 days...1. The product is a bit tricky to setup with the app and you have to follow YouTube videos to get it setup. I wish Xiaomi provides video tutorial links in their user manuals. They don't mention it but we need Bluetooth and WiFi connection to be setup, for the app and robot  to work together. This tip is missing in user manual.2. WiFi connectivity does get lost sometimes but that is because my router is far from certain places in my house. That time the robot needs to be brought back to the WiFi range. 5GHz connection does not work with this model.3. The robot takes anywhere between 40-60 minutes to completely vaccum my 800 sq. ft house. Battery life is really good in the new model. 50% or more is still left after one complete sweep or mop cycle of my house. Charging is also not bad. It took 1.5 hrs for it to charge full 100% the first time.4. Couple of times it got confused in a specific area in my house and I had to reset the entire house map for it to work properly again. Once the map was created and the device has sweeped and mopped that area for a couple of times, it would not repeat this behavior.5. Dusting is of A1 quality. Each time the amount of dust collected is staggering. We never knew we had so much dust in our house!6. Mopping is average. I would call it \"light wiping\" and not mopping. Hard stains or sticky stains or dry stains are not affected by the mopping. Only light dust or weak stickiness gets wiped out. Adding a bit of floor cleaning liquid or Vim liquid in the water helps.7. Vacuum + Mop mixed mode is limited in its effectiveness. In this mode, mopping sometimes wets the floor and causes dry dust to stick to the floor which the vaccum is not able to pick up.I recommend vacuum and mop as two separate cycles.8. Keeping mop extension attached to the robot all the time causes mopping cloth to accumulate dirt, and when it gets dragged along the floor it causes wet dirty mop to be wiped around the house. This is not ideal. So it's important to remove that extension from the vacuum bot when you are only vacuuming and not mopping.9. The mop works horribly on door mats (main door or bathroom mats). It gets very dirty when it moves over mats and then that wet dirt spreads all over the place. So please remove all the mats, esp. during mopping session.10. Noise levels are pretty low in medium mode. Sometimes we don't even know where it has gone, it gets so quiet.Pros.* Battery life* Suction power* Noise levels* VacuumingCons* Mopping is average. It's at best can be called as light wiping.* Setup is bit tricky, user manual is insufficient. Xiaomi does not contact or send any demo person at home. You have to figure it out using YouTube videos. I can see old people or non tech savvy people will highly struggle with this thing.* Once the device is confused it doesn't correct itself automatically. It needs a map reset.* Door mats make the mop even dirtier so please remove them or other items on the floor before mopping.Such tips nobody gives you and you have to learn them on your own.But I still recommend this device as it is very effective in sweeping the dust in the house clean.,ProsFor cleaning dust it is very good .we can set daily schedule.even if we forget to do so it will automatically does the work by setting schedule ...cleaning the box after its work is also not  very hectic..brushes are providing..We can set restricted areas.ConesMost of the hairs n threads are stuck through the round main brush.. little difficult to clear the brush.It has been more than 1 year iam using this.One time the movement is low .when ichecked..so many hairs are stucked in its wheel.it was little  difficult to clear the hair strands.Mopping it is average only..only takes very little amount of water.so oily things will remain in the floor..once or twice  in week we have to do mopping with plenty of water and lizol..It can't reach the sharp corners also.Once we create restricted area..by the time of using it couldn't detect the proper area we marked..so it enter those area and get stuck most of the times.it is main thing I hate about this product..remaining things are okay....then we have to reset the map and set restricted area again..it is bit annoyingOverall it is very good for me...my brooming is almost completely replaced by this ...once in week I do the complete cleaning with broom to all areas that didn't covered by this machine ..,In all other aspect like, price, battery,app feature, suction and cleaning its really very good product.I find it very useful and nice to have product.So will directly make note of  some drawbacks/improvent area, i observed.1) Sometimes it gets confused or leaves a specific section of bedroom even though there has been no obstacle.2) Its little noisy or I will say not a silent thing in standard suction power, though that with any vaccuum cleaner.3) Xiaomi could have provides extra Hepa filter with it.4) vaccum+mop doesn't clean properly and rather sticks dust to floor because of wet brush, so I do vaccum and then only mop subsequently is best option.5) Charging is super slow, if compared with any 5200mAh battery with mobile fast charger, its ~10 times slower despite such, a big docking charger.,I am a bachelor and i do not like Maid coming to my house.this solves the purpose. It is great at vacuuming my 2000 Sqft house. It can do it on turbo mode with dual cleaning in single battery life. was surprised with the vacuum power and battery life. It collects way more dust than the manual brooming.It can skip corners and narrow places. Once in a while i just broom the corners and bring the dust in the middle before turning the robot on.5/5 for navigation and room mapping.Mopping is equally bad. Mop does not cover whole area and it leaves trails. it leaves the floor looking worse than the un mopped floor. Also water tank broke in just few cleanings.Recommended for vacuuming purpose.,Very good product. Very helpful product in my home.,We purchased the product in April and now it is not working.After charging it is running for less than one minute and getting stopped,Easy to use and Working well little bit of noise is there but acceptable.,Helping hand. More reliable than maids. Does the job well. Once in 4 days you need to mop yourself. Good suction power.",

I bought them 4 or 5 years ago and there are various issues with them. Wanted to buy this Qubo camera and give it a try as this is Made in India and from the famous Hero Group. The product did live up to my expectation!!Here are my observations:Pros:- Excellent in performance.- Accurate in motion detection.- Can connect anytime from anywhere if the camera is connected to the internet.- LED turns red when there is no internet connectivity.- Crystal clear vision even in night.Cons:- Had to struggle a bit in configuring it. The usability of the app is not easy to understand. Figured out the right options to use after few trials. Hence giving 4 star rating.- The LED doesn't glow green when it is recording though the option is turned on.Keep it up Hero Group and looking forward to more such great products from your organization!!,The Qubo 360 camera is great. I am able to set it up for my kittens whom I can be assured once I leave my house for some time. The best feature is the two way talk in which we can communicate via the camera itself.,Product is very easy to install as well as setup and use. It is excellent motion detection and also has person detection which is not available in this price range.,Camera quality and clarity are good. Also having excellent features. This camera was delivered on time and the tech support is also good. :)The only missing feature is that this camera lacks storage to external nvr.,I bought this model for my living room, it‚Äôs very decent and easy to install. Working very well.,It is I goo product I  using It and I hai be over 1 month and I have no issues with this product,Target has to fixed as it observed motion and went over there( on wall) it get stuck over there as no motion now next.,Great product. Works well, just faced couple of issues while setting up but after that it is working great.",

Simply insert two AA batteries and you are good to go - best results with Duracell.Attractive and secure packaging. Express delivery. Very satisfied!,First hand experience with this product is quite good. It does the task with ease. Will use this product more than 1 month then will edit this review. But for now the product is simply amazing at this price range.,It was working well and suddenly after four months it stopped working. At first i thought I needed new batteries but even with new batteries it's not working just in 4 months i haven't even used it completely for 30 days in the 4 months I've had it.,Great product and easy to use, hoping I will not face any issues as mentioned in some comments.,Easy to use,The quality and speed of the product are just amazing...I thought it was costly but it's worth the money.....blindly go with this..thank u so much,Product is good till now I have used it 3-4 times but still to use more and if anything goes wrong have to check their customer service..

        "review_content": "First of All Delivery of Amazon: It was as specified no delays. Hence, appreciate it.Packaging: Not Good. The box was tempered, torn and damaged.Product: Ordered Black, received brown. Didn‚Äôt replace as the Color didn‚Äôt much mattered. Issue is with the seller though.Performance: The pen of good. Robust, feels cheap however, looking at the price not to complain. Writes smooth.For anyone who wants to enter into fountain pens, can start with this as it does the job.Edited: Have been using this pen for over 3 days now, I am facing issue of nib dryness. If I don‚Äôt use the pen for sometime. The pen doesn‚Äôt write at all. I have to wet the nib or do something or the other in order to make it start writing. It writes great when it starts writing. But the initial pick up is really bad. I have a platinum preppy too. It‚Äôs a better option to go with if the budget is tight. However, there we have good writing but bad looks.,Few points I have been reading about this pen which I would like to answer. (Compared with two other pens- Parker Vector and Luxor V5)1. Grip  Read in couple of reviews regarding the thick grip and the \"curve\" at the grip which makes it awkward to hold. Honestly, have not felt so at all. The grip is pretty medium, larger than Parker Vector and comparable to the Luxor V5. It wont create any problems holding it. I am an average 5'10 and people of same build, hand and finger size wont be any problem. Also on Parker Vector the metal body starts to feel slippery due to metal, small grip and feels tiresome after writing couple of pages. Been nice to hold the Elegante and feel firm in hand, it makes one feel like holding a pen with substance :) .2. Nib and feeder:  It says Fine on the nib and it is comparable to the Luxor V5 0.5 and Parker Fine nib. Few claim it is 0.7 / medium kinds. Its all about the pressure on puts when writing it. I just touch the nib on paper and rest the pen does, so would say- it is Fine. It is way too smoooooother and fluent than Parker which felt a bit rough. Parker Fine nibs give a feedback making it bit of a dragging experience. However on Elegante the nib just flows and slides over the paper. It is not only the nib but also the feeder which ensures the nib slides. The feeder ensures that there is even flow of ink through out the writing experience. The writing it leaves is slightly wet and not dry, personally i prefer that over the dry and dragging. This ensures that one gets to write about 6 pages i.e 12 sides without a refill.3.  Plastic construction and feel in hand:  The cap is made of brass(as they say). The cap has a \"matte\" finish, not a glossy one. The clip and top is glossy. Gives a fair enough good contrast to add some \"looks\" to it when taking it out of the pocket :D . The pen itself- very much plastic. If I try to weigh both the cap and pen separately, roughly they feel of same weight, it is that light weight ( just a feel factor how I felt). However this does not mean it is a cheap construction. It has fallen from 2 floors down and did not crack anywhere, so would say its good strong plastic. It makes one feel pretty solid holding it. The size if compared to other two is larger. It rests pretty well in between my thumb and index finger(which parker does not, Luxor does) , hence never needed to put the clip on the rear. Without the clip it is very much balanced (Parker and Luxor both feel well balanced without the cap placed on top) , with clip Elegante and Parker feel a bit -top heavy.4. Ink filling:  Personally always been a fan of eyedroppers(good old school days) , however this comes with the standard piston filling( as seen in the photo by Hari). When I immersed the nib in the pen and pulled the piston it just filled half. Had to dip the whole nib till the grip when it got filled. In parker just dipping the top nib was sufficient. For Luxor pulling the whole top part out and then refuel it seemed very tedious. Some other reviews I read people have tried removing the piston converter and used it as eyedropper!!! Few said it worked , few said it leaked. Need to substantiate it. Not sure and hence wont try this out to spoil such a nice piece. If anyone has tried would love to hear your experience.5. Writing after 3 weeks:  For Luxor, it works immediately! Even after 6 months it worked like magic. For Parker bit of dipping, or couple of splashing out and it starts. For Elegante it did not start immediately. From school days used to have an Airmail (unfortunately misplaced it when i shifted) it used to work like a beauty even after 3 weeks. Elegante on this aspect did not fair so well. However, how many of us are not going to use their Pen for 3 weeks, always something to write, sign or pen down :) . It worked fairly after a break of one week.6. Colour:  Personally the \"looks\" of a pen hardly matter to me. Its the balance in hand and the nib which are the real heart and soul. We pay crazy on high class pens just for the looks. For few people this matters more- individual choice and nothing against it.  Parker gives a good classy look, Luxor makes one feel more of a student than a person with authority or executive. Elegante would be a mix of both and middle of both. Neither a college going look nor an Executive look. On looks it does fair enough justice- The cap and two metal rings is all that makes it stand apart. Would have loved if they would have made more colours than Maroon, Black and Blue. Nonetheless these colours are the royal colours and pretty good than what Reynolds have- bright designs which are more for school going kids to attract them. This does enough for me.7. Spare Nibs and feeder:  Not sure if there are spare nibs available online. I am at a location which is 100s of km away from any civilization in a jungle or a desert and only way is to order online (thankfully speed post delivers faster than couriers :lticaptd: ) . After using this nib, I would personally not place any other nib. I am pretty happy about it. (always good habit to have spare nibs, dont know when one drops it and needs to change).8. Recommended for:  Its a must for student. At this price range where one is still studying and not earning, this sounds a good buy, though not the best as Luxor beats this is VFM. Parker, would never recommend it for students. If someone wants to carry it for exams- carry 2 atleast, all due to the limited piston converter capacity. Luxor- would be best. If you are an executive sitting in a board of meetings where you want to make a statement by what you carry then there are many other alternatives. This is fair on looks and pleasure for writing :)  :)  :) .9. Value for Money:  For a standard person like me or a student, Luxor beats Elegante and Parker. However for a fountain pen- This is an excellent VFM :)Well, this sums up my experience after using it. Anyone has anything more to add to this or share their side we all would love to hear it,‚òÖ First of all, it came in a really bad condition. The package was almost flattened. All thanks to the people connected with the transition and delivery. Thank God it doesn't have any dent.‚òÖ Secondly, it is probably a used product. Because it came with the smell of ink in it out of the box.‚òÖ Thirdly, the brand claims that it is having a fine nib, but probably according to the European standards. I am a Pilot lover, so I know what fine nib is. This is medium sized nib at its best according to the standards of Pilot. Using a pen with fine nib is like having a perfect orgasm. You remember the experience for a long time. The handwriting also becomes better. That's lacking in this pen.* Thankfully it doesn't squirt ink every now and then like most of the other cheap fountain pens. I had two Wingsungs. Those were unbearably squirty.‚òÖ Fourthly, the grip is average.‚òÖ Fifthly, if you are a beginner, you may go for it, as it will obviously let you get used to the fountain pens. You may use it as a day to day pen.BUT DON'T STICK WITH THIS ONE ONLY. EXPLORE THE WORLD OF PILOT IF YOU HAVE THE BUDGET. TRUST ME, YOU WON'T LOOK BACK TO A PEN LIKE THIS. I WAS GIFTED A PILOT CROCODILE FINE NIB BY MY MOM. I WANT TO KEEP MY MEMORIES WITH THIS PEN SAFE. SO I DON'T USUALLY USE THAT. THAT'S WHY I'VE BOUGHT THIS ONE.‚òÖ Lastly and most importantly, a suggestion to the buyers, to make your pen experience ergonomic, please don't put the cap on the backside. Open the cap, keep it aside and unleash your writing...,very nice pen., it's really amazing very smooth writing.thank you seller & amazon.,Its not for speedy writing, if you are use for signature its cutting off character,...., Some time spread over ink. And some time character cutting.... Cheap plastic product but at a 200 good for beginners.,I've been using this pen for about 3monthspros:Build quality for this price is amazinggold Nib looks amazingcons:Nib comes out easily,Just that the neck area of the pen was little broad for me to get used to ..,Guys I have started using fountain pens again a few months back. I had used all types of fountain pens during my school days like COLLEGE brand eye droppers, Camlin, Parker (made in USA), Hero (China made). Recently I am using Platinum Preppy which is very smooth and excellent pen and yes expected since it is Japan made. This the Camlin Elegante is our very own Made in India pen. It makes us proud. Just superb pen. Very smooth. It is actually a no nonsense pen. Only thing...since I had read a few negative reviews about this...I am using it with PILOT BLUE ink. I don't know whether ink quality is further improving its performance or what? Whatever it may be.....This pen with Pilot ink combination rocks...just superb experience of writing with THE FOUNTSIN PEN. Thank you Camlin and Thank you Amazon",

Better in prospect of charging . It is far better in durability from the original apple wire. Do not think more you can buy blindly worth to buy and it is mfi certified so you IOS device not damaged. But small negative point is packaging quality of the product.,The charger is a great carry on accessory while travelling without risking the original charger.Price is also very affordable and charging speed is very good with good adaptor or power bank.,Good product , can recommend all , only thing I see as issue is the material,, the cable threads peels off when stick to a Velcro materials. Other wise good product, charges very well like original,Nice,Reliable and worth it,The cable shipped in box made by Apple felt less sturdy and reliable after using one or two times and felt it would break more quickly at the lighting port and had to order Amazon basics cable which is miles better and apple MiFi certified,",

        "review_content": "I am using this on an old Mac Mini, since the Broadcom proprietary drivers aren't available and the replacement B43 drivers don't allow for sufficient download speeds, at least in my experience. I got this device up and running with Ubuntu 22.04 with Linux 5.15.0-56-generic.Google search for \"morrownr/8821au-20210708\" and use the driver on Github. I'm using the product \"TP-Link AC600\" btw. If you are using the other variant sold on Amazon, use lsusb and find out which network interface you are going to have to install drivers for. GIYF.I will admit, this is probably going to be hard for someone who is not generally comfortable with a shell, bash for example. But even though I had never used dkms or iw before, the Github repo along with the build tools available in the jammy repo made it easy enough to get the device working (read the GitHub Readme).To be sure I first got the drivers working in a local Ubuntu VM using Guest Additions to connect to the USB device directly from the guest OS, which also worked.Ultimately, I installed the OS on the host and setup the drivers using USB tethering. I then got the same download speed using this device I was previously getting on my other network interfaces on Windows and Mac, but now on Ubuntu.The device itself is a bit sensitive to the antenna direction when it comes to the impact on download speed. Have been using for about a month now without complaints.,Do not go for reviews that say that it do not support kali. Me and some of my friends all are using it for Wi-Fi hacking and it works really well, it also supports monitor mode. If you are having issues in connecting it to your Kali machine then just go through the web surf a bit and you will find relevant articles on how to connect this TP link adapter to your kali machine. There is also a driver of realtek which you might need to install to make it work in your kali machine.I have given it 4 stars just because the performance if not good as the Alpha adapters which is reasonable for this range of price but in this range and for as a beginner it is the best adapter you can buy.,Nice product. Working fine. My PC is now 5G  Price is too high so giving 4 star,Got the Wi-Fi in one of the rooms from 0 to 70%. Has been working well since a month now. Good alternative to a repeater if only a single device needs to access the Wi-Fi from a corner.,The product is very nice and have good Wifi signal. Using this for over a month now, no complain. But when it for the first time, you need to install the driver on your desktop/laptop from the TP link website to make it operational, which is not very well explained in the manual.,This product is very good,I have buy this product because my laptop don‚Äôt support wifi 5ghz band, in 2.5 ghz I receive 30-40Mbps speed only but my broadband plan is 150Mbps.1. Easy to use plug and play windows 102. Good signal i am using another room from router no signal drop , I receive full signal.3. Little bit expensive but go with this because of good signal.4. I receive 170Mbps + download and 110Mbps upload speed on 5ghz and my broadband plan is 150Mbps.I highly recommend this product.,i purchase this product for company use and this is a very good product.",

As a result I have stopped turning the tv off from the mains. I just use remote control to put it on stand by. BUT THIS IS A PROBLEM IN THE LONG RUN,,Display is very good. Sound is average iam using soundbar so no issues for me. Don't know how long it will last due to my previous mi 55 4 pro panel gone in 2.5 years.

        "review_content": "Bought this instead of original apple, does the work for 150rs, not as fast as apple charger but its a good option if you want cheap and good product, bought it for iPad pro 10.5 and it's working flawlessly, build quality is ok, its not like i am gonna hang my clothes on it and i want a very strong cable, even a braided cable stop working after a year, i have used both Anker and Apple store strong braided cable they all stop working after a year so please don't buy high end cables just for that instead choose a this one and even if it's stops working withing a year you only loose 150rs compares to 2000rs.UPDATE------------------------------------pin has stopped charging from one side, now i have to slip the pin to charge from other side, but i will update and let know for how long does it work,,It‚Äôs good. Not sure about durability as the pin area feels a bit fragile,Does not support apple carplaySo was little disappointed about thatOther than that cable is made up of very good quality,Best to buy,100% NOT FATHFUL,Writing this review post 10 months and 3 orders of the same product.Honestly Portronics Konnect L lightning cable works like magic with the original Apple charging brick.Seeing the price of the cable I initially hesitated buying as it was as low as ‚Çπ99/- with the offers and so I wasn‚Äôt sure if it would work well with my iPhone 12 or whether it would impact my iPhone‚Äôs battery health because all the other lightning cable brands were costing over ‚Çπ350/- like Wayona, Amazon Basics, etc.Earlier I was using Wayona Brand lightning cable with eventually frayed and stopped working.Charging Speed:Charges my iPhone fast enough almost similar compared to the original cable level when used with 12W Original Apple power adapter.Quality and Durability:Great quality braided cable and doesn‚Äôt tangle easily and can withstand day-to-day usage.L-Shaped pin:This is very innovative by Portronics and it makes sure the cable doesn‚Äôt get damaged even if used while charging.CarPlay and Data Sync:Works smoothly with CarPlay and syncs data effortlessly.PS: I have used this cable only with the Original Apple Charging Brick and extremely satisfied with its performance.,Better than I expect the product I like that Quality and I plan to buy same type cable come with usb C to Lighting cable for emergency purpose that much I love this cable. Buy for this cable only emergency uses only since Good one,Good product and value for money",

Product is good if you need to heat water not milk.Initially there were no issue in Auto cut but last week it stopped working.Overall in this price range i will say Yes for this.,Very useful. My needs are fulfilled. Thank you.,Good product,Product looks good but Boiling milk in this kettle burns the base of the kettle it becomes full black and brown ,And eggs don't get boiled in a single go .,Nice product,After 2 months of usage, some issues have come up. Once it gets to the boiling point, it should automatically switch off but it keeps on bubbling till it is switched off manually. Next is that the water vapors and heat can be felt through the kettle on/off switch which I believe is dangerous. We ordered this trusting Prestige to be of high quality but it doesn't satisfy the purpose.,After using only one month kettle on /off switch is not working and red light is also not working.Some times it's boiling time is too fast and some times too slow.,This catle works good but difficult to clean .",

As a result I have stopped turning the tv off from the mains. I just use remote control to put it on stand by. BUT THIS IS A PROBLEM IN THE LONG RUN,,Display is very good. Sound is average iam using soundbar so no issues for me. Don't know how long it will last due to my previous mi 55 4 pro panel gone in 2.5 years. Bought this tv with 2 year warranty on panel.,improve the software response and improve the picture quality. worth for money for this budget (4K).,I have used 2-4 days.

The only problem I am facing is each time I turn off the tv from the mains, I have to go to the settings and turn the settings on to tv speaker settings despite no other speaker or WiFi or blue tooth or cell phone being in the proximity. As a result I have stopped turning the tv off from the mains. I just use remote control to put it on stand by. BUT THIS IS A PROBLEM IN THE LONG RUN,,Display is very good. Sound is average iam using soundbar so no issues for me. Don't know how long it will last due to my previous mi 55 4 pro panel gone in 2.5 years. Bought this tv with 2 year warranty on panel.,improve the software response and improve the picture quality. worth for money for this budget (4K).,I have used 2-4 days.

                "review_content": "I am posting this after a few weeks of using the product.Usage: Continuous, OTT only, no Cable/Dish operator.Average daily usage: 6-8 hours.The TV is a great value-for-money product.Installation: The installation was simple and Amazon assisted installation was smooth, timely and hassle-free.Picture: The picture quality is not great when compared with the smoothness of a Sony, LG and Samsung with these kind of specs. Movies and especially hi-res TV series experience was somewhat diluted as most of the times, the output, while in hi-res , wouldn't look like a movie quality which we are used to of watching in the likes of Sony, Samsung LG etc however, with time, you get used to it and only realize the difference when you see the same movie at someone else's better TV.Sound: Sound output is decent. You wouldn't need additional support to enhance the volume as such.Remote: Sleek, sensitive and user-friendly. It's exactly like Amazon's remote.OS: Same as any smart Android TV. Works smoothly without much lags or hiccups. Switching apps from one to another takes a a couple of seconds more than Sony but unless you have used to of those performances, it looks just fine.Standalone and as your first smart TV,  you wouldn't find any reasons to not like the quality and it would like hi-res from the beginning. It is a great value for money product without a doubt.However, if you are considering this as an alternative or second TV after owning the better ones in the past, you will have a hard time adjusting with it.,Picture quality is good for this price, didn‚Äôt faced any lag on UI and browsing other apps. Only negative will be audio, definitely need a sound bar if u are a frequent movie watcher. Overall worth for money u spend. But the installation process is just awful, Amazon claiming that a trained professional will visit for installation but neither they are trained nor professionals , just read the installation manuals and installed the wall mount which took 4hours for them to buy the wall mount after charging money. No demo given on Tv as they have no idea about the product, these things making to think twice or thrice to buy a tv through online.,Screen looks amazing but problem is with processor I believe. If 4k content is getting streamed on device then we can observe the green screen flickers(not so often but problem exists), even remote control is not good as it take at least 2 sec to react for the user action.Reason why I believe processor is bad because I do 4k gaming using PS5 and never encountered problem with the screen.,If you buy TV in a small town shop, it will be delivered and installed immediately within couple of hours. When you want to buy a TV from Amazon, you need to wait for it to be delivered for couple of days and it is understandable. The problem is with the installation, they take so much time to install that you end up regretting buying the product. It‚Äôs like you are hungry and food is in front of you but you can‚Äôt eat. So I ordered my TV on Monday, it got delivered on Friday and it will be installed on Monday because of weekend where as there is no concept of weekend in small towns. If we had the technician details, we could reach out  s get it installed but that also will be shared 4 hours before.Regarding product, it‚Äôs good quality and very good for a average user. Heavy duty like games and continuous usage on some store will be challenging, I guess.,This TV gives good results within the budget, should definitely buy if the budget is 30k but most important point like to mention is after sales service and also the installation part.1) The installation guy didn‚Äôt arrive at very first day that was scheduled, even after rescheduling he didn‚Äôt came for installation purpose. So strictly be aware of this point.2) The TV I got in offer with 3k discount on ICICI card but although the product came out defective, it had dead pixel on the display which is very bad after period of time.3) Even after the fault was from seller as it was defective piece I didn‚Äôt got the replacement for the product and it‚Äôs totally unfair deal by Amazon and the seller too.Final verdict is the TV quality and feature are good but the service from seller and Amazon that is got was very poor inspite I was prime member. The seller DAWNTECH ELECTRONICS PRIVATE LIMITED gives very poor service and feel bad that in such cases Amazon will not help you. Thankyou,Team,Also to be added TV installation services with product while delivering and unboxing. NO need to other sub-vendor to getting installation and demo. Also dependency on third-party involvement should be less.Bad experience with TV installation stuff.Pls look into this .,Picture quality good. Sound quality  not upto my 3xpectations. Not able to find the real Dolby stereo effect. Remote not upto the mark.4 ‚≠ê for picture quality, 3‚≠ê for both sound and remote quality,Good quality picture but it hangs on home screen",

Turns out the \"cap\" was actually a pretty nice container to blend small amounts of anything. The container itself seems of great quality, has measurements on the side, and also comes with a lid so that nothing splatters outside when you're using the blender.2) There is also a holder with some nails if you wanna mount the blender on a wall.3) The blender itself is amazing to hold, looks great, and is pretty easy to use.4) The blender can even stand on its own if you have to leave it and attend to something else. If you place it vertically, you can leave it as it is.Cons:1) After over 15 seconds of continuous blending (that is, if I'm not just pulsing it but continuously blending), there is this smell of some sort that starts to come from the blender. I'm not sure if that's a sign of overheating, or if it's normal.2) There's this groove right above the blade, and every time I'm done washing, there's always a little residue that was hiding in that groove which always comes out a few seconds after I'm done washing, and I always have to go back to clean that. So that's a small inconvenience.But it's overall great, and I'd highly recommend getting this product!,Good,Making the life easy.,Great durability and original products,Very nice product for small or moderate usage.,Good product,Very good,Very useful product in day to day work",

So there are chances that if a 100 watt charger is used, it may heat up a lot. Overall the cord is well make, very sturdy and the materials indicate that this cord will be very very durable. The price would could have been on the lower side due to heating otherwise its a good buy.,Good for buy,Like it,I got this for my samsung s10 lite and it is compatible with super fast charger and charged my phone in Super fast charge mode. Value for money. Could not post picture but product is good. Far better than original Samsung cable which cost almost same.,The cable is sterdy, the ends are premium. Charges my One Plus 7T rapidly. Great data transfers on my Macbook as well. I am happy with the purchase.,Good cable,Worth it. Quality of cable is very good.

A good watch for newbies like me with lots of amazing functionalities. Apart from that, this watch is a value for money at this price range. The sleep tracker works decently well, could have been better. We can call directly using the watch, i like that feature well. Need not reach for phone everytime. The screen touch is also well. There are lots of watch faces which you can change to or upload one from your own galary which is a plus point. The product looks exactly as shown in the pictures. The calorie and heart beat tracker are also quite accurate. The watch is a bit uncomfortable to watch at times, but otherwise the straps are good and strong,I have been using this watch since a month and its really great. All features are working quite well and connectivity with phone is also good.Screen quality may be improved.,Actually my smart watch BSW043 Ring 3 is not charging 2 to 3 days. It's off I tired to msg fireballs but it alway say to follow our page on Instagram. And when we follow its shows you their new offers. I don't know what to do now. I just submitted the warranty form.,The watch worked for the 2-3 Months and got switched off automatically and Rear Panel also got opened automatically..,I didn't charge it for 2 days, now after charging also it is not getting on,I have been using this watch since a month and its really great.

Not sure about durability as the pin area feels a bit fragile,Does not support apple carplaySo was little disappointed about thatOther than that cable is made up of very good quality,Best to buy,100% NOT FATHFUL,Writing this review post 10 months and 3 orders of the same product.Honestly Portronics Konnect L lightning cable works like magic with the original Apple charging brick.Seeing the price of the cable I initially hesitated buying as it was as low as ‚Çπ99/- with the offers and so I wasn‚Äôt sure if it would work well with my iPhone 12 or whether it would impact my iPhone‚Äôs battery health because all the other lightning cable brands were costing over ‚Çπ350/- like Wayona, Amazon Basics, etc.Earlier I was using Wayona Brand lightning cable with eventually frayed and stopped working.Charging Speed:Charges my iPhone fast enough almost similar compared to the original cable level when used with 12W Original Apple power adapter.Quality and Durability:Great quality braided cable and doesn‚Äôt tangle easily and can withstand day-to-day usage.L-Shaped pin:This is very innovative by Portronics and it makes sure the cable doesn‚Äôt get damaged even if used while charging.CarPlay and Data Sync:Works smoothly with CarPlay and syncs data effortlessly.PS: I have used this cable only with the Original Apple Charging Brick and extremely satisfied with its performance.,Better than I expect the product I like that Quality and I plan to buy same type cable come with usb C to Lighting cable for emergency purpose that much I love this cable. Buy for this cable only emergency uses only since Good one,Good product and value for money",

Product is good if you need to heat water not milk.Initially there were no issue in Auto cut but last week it stopped working.Overall in this price range i will say Yes for this.,Very useful. My needs are fulfilled. Thank you.,Good product,Product looks good but Boiling milk in this kettle burns the base of the kettle it becomes full black and brown ,And eggs don't get boiled in a single go .,Nice product,After 2 months of usage, some issues have come up. Once it gets to the boiling point, it should automatically switch off but it keeps on bubbling till it is switched off manually. Next is that the water vapors and heat can be felt through the kettle on/off switch which I believe is dangerous. We ordered this trusting Prestige to be of high quality but it doesn't satisfy the purpose.,After using only one month kettle on /off switch is not working and red light is also not working.Some times it's boiling time is too fast and some times too slow.,This catle works good but difficult to clean .",

        "review_content": "I am not big on camera usage, personally. I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging, but it was just a little and so I could have ignored it. But then it started heating up more and got me very concerned. I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don't perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you (or not) in terms of camera and heating. I had many questions about these aspects before buying. Perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy (or avoid). Cheers.,Display - BeautyCamera - decentPerformance - AmazingBattery - ok (in 5000mah u expect more tbh)Overall good phone...Also after 1day of use, i found some network connectivity issue in my jiosim, which I'm using right now in this phone, but I'll keep update this review after 1month of usage!,It's a decent mobile under this price but few things worried me , weight of the phone, too many procedure to change some settings, no screen casting. Apart from that it has good touch, a decent camera for day light , battery life is good.,I bought this smartphone for my mom. Samusung interface is very handful for easy use. Battery is superb, last whole day. Camera is mediocre but provide original colour pictures. All in all satisfied with this smartphone that i got in sale for 9499.,Unable to do video call within same service provider as in VOLTE within same service provider video call feature is available.,Product is fine.  Nothing Fancy but for the budget it is a good phone.,BATTERY : more than enough for normal use  Not sure in gamingCAMERA : good in this segment , can record  videos in FHD 30fpsDISPLAY : since it's a LCD display the quality is  a bit less , but goodV RAM : you can add upto 2gb of virtual ram  but have to sacrifice your storage  Space to use it  OVERALL A GOOD BUDGET PHONE,Finger print is working speedy battery backup is good camera quality is also good",

        "review_content": "My review of using new Vacuum Mop Pro 2 for 3 days...1. The product is a bit tricky to setup with the app and you have to follow YouTube videos to get it setup. I wish Xiaomi provides video tutorial links in their user manuals. They don't mention it but we need Bluetooth and WiFi connection to be setup, for the app and robot  to work together. This tip is missing in user manual.2. WiFi connectivity does get lost sometimes but that is because my router is far from certain places in my house. That time the robot needs to be brought back to the WiFi range. 5GHz connection does not work with this model.3. The robot takes anywhere between 40-60 minutes to completely vaccum my 800 sq. ft house. Battery life is really good in the new model. 50% or more is still left after one complete sweep or mop cycle of my house. Charging is also not bad. It took 1.5 hrs for it to charge full 100% the first time.4. Couple of times it got confused in a specific area in my house and I had to reset the entire house map for it to work properly again. Once the map was created and the device has sweeped and mopped that area for a couple of times, it would not repeat this behavior.5. Dusting is of A1 quality. Each time the amount of dust collected is staggering. We never knew we had so much dust in our house!6. Mopping is average. I would call it \"light wiping\" and not mopping. Hard stains or sticky stains or dry stains are not affected by the mopping. Only light dust or weak stickiness gets wiped out. Adding a bit of floor cleaning liquid or Vim liquid in the water helps.7. Vacuum + Mop mixed mode is limited in its effectiveness. In this mode, mopping sometimes wets the floor and causes dry dust to stick to the floor which the vaccum is not able to pick up.I recommend vacuum and mop as two separate cycles.8. Keeping mop extension attached to the robot all the time causes mopping cloth to accumulate dirt, and when it gets dragged along the floor it causes wet dirty mop to be wiped around the house. This is not ideal. So it's important to remove that extension from the vacuum bot when you are only vacuuming and not mopping.9. The mop works horribly on door mats (main door or bathroom mats). It gets very dirty when it moves over mats and then that wet dirt spreads all over the place. So please remove all the mats, esp. during mopping session.10. Noise levels are pretty low in medium mode. Sometimes we don't even know where it has gone, it gets so quiet.Pros.* Battery life* Suction power* Noise levels* VacuumingCons* Mopping is average. It's at best can be called as light wiping.* Setup is bit tricky, user manual is insufficient. Xiaomi does not contact or send any demo person at home. You have to figure it out using YouTube videos. I can see old people or non tech savvy people will highly struggle with this thing.* Once the device is confused it doesn't correct itself automatically. It needs a map reset.* Door mats make the mop even dirtier so please remove them or other items on the floor before mopping.Such tips nobody gives you and you have to learn them on your own.But I still recommend this device as it is very effective in sweeping the dust in the house clean.,ProsFor cleaning dust it is very good .we can set daily schedule.even if we forget to do so it will automatically does the work by setting schedule ...cleaning the box after its work is also not  very hectic..brushes are providing..We can set restricted areas.ConesMost of the hairs n threads are stuck through the round main brush.. little difficult to clear the brush.It has been more than 1 year iam using this.One time the movement is low .when ichecked..so many hairs are stucked in its wheel.it was little  difficult to clear the hair strands.Mopping it is average only..only takes very little amount of water.so oily things will remain in the floor..once or twice  in week we have to do mopping with plenty of water and lizol..It can't reach the sharp corners also.Once we create restricted area..by the time of using it couldn't detect the proper area we marked..so it enter those area and get stuck most of the times.it is main thing I hate about this product..remaining things are okay....then we have to reset the map and set restricted area again..it is bit annoyingOverall it is very good for me...my brooming is almost completely replaced by this ...once in week I do the complete cleaning with broom to all areas that didn't covered by this machine ..,In all other aspect like, price, battery,app feature, suction and cleaning its really very good product.I find it very useful and nice to have product.So will directly make note of  some drawbacks/improvent area, i observed.1) Sometimes it gets confused or leaves a specific section of bedroom even though there has been no obstacle.2) Its little noisy or I will say not a silent thing in standard suction power, though that with any vaccuum cleaner.3) Xiaomi could have provides extra Hepa filter with it.4) vaccum+mop doesn't clean properly and rather sticks dust to floor because of wet brush, so I do vaccum and then only mop subsequently is best option.5) Charging is super slow, if compared with any 5200mAh battery with mobile fast charger, its ~10 times slower despite such, a big docking charger.,I am a bachelor and i do not like Maid coming to my house.this solves the purpose. It is great at vacuuming my 2000 Sqft house. It can do it on turbo mode with dual cleaning in single battery life. was surprised with the vacuum power and battery life. It collects way more dust than the manual brooming.It can skip corners and narrow places. Once in a while i just broom the corners and bring the dust in the middle before turning the robot on.5/5 for navigation and room mapping.Mopping is equally bad. Mop does not cover whole area and it leaves trails. it leaves the floor looking worse than the un mopped floor. Also water tank broke in just few cleanings.Recommended for vacuuming purpose.,Very good product. Very helpful product in my home.,We purchased the product in April and now it is not working.After charging it is running for less than one minute and getting stopped,Easy to use and Working well little bit of noise is there but acceptable.,Helping hand. More reliable than maids. Does the job well. Once in 4 days you need to mop yourself. Good suction power.",

I add a couple of ice cubes and it manages to crush them, but needs more than one cycle. Battery life is acceptable, I charge after every 5-6 uses. The motor runs at full all the time, I thought that I would be able to tell when the battery gets low but no, it will simply stop at the last second with no way to tell if it is getting low. Initially I wondered if the exposed charging port would lead to any problems or not, but I have been careful with it and have had no issues.I find it to be a great and useful product for one person. Get a proper non-portable blender if you want to use it for blending hard, dry substances, or for multiple people.,Easy to use,Best Blender used so far,Great product. Very compact and easy to carry. Can‚Äôt blend hard items but works for soft fruit smoothies or milkshakes. We liked this product,Build is solid. And the motor is powerful enough for its purpose. It would have been perfect if the charging port was not exposed.,Good oneSatisfied,I am using this product since 2weeks.It is good upto now. I am using this for only milk shake with banana only.its blending is good,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yaKvhqNSL._SY88.jpg",
